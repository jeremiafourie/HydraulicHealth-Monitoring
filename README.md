## ðŸ“š Project Overview
Use sensor readings from a hydraulic test rig to predict health indices (0â€“100) for four components (pump, valve, cooler, accumulator). Compare simple regressors (Random Forest) with sequence models (LSTM) and build a mini dashboard for earlyâ€‘warning alerts.

## Problem Statement
Hydraulic component failures cause costly downtime.  
**Goal:** Given current cycleâ€™s sensor data, predict each componentâ€™s health so maintenance can be scheduled before failure.

## Hypotheses
1. Combining pressure, flow, temperature, and power sensors improves accuracy.  
2. Slidingâ€‘window statistics (mean, std, slope over recent cycles) outperform singleâ€‘cycle inputs.  
3. An LSTM sequence model reduces error versus tabular methods.
